Opium release 1.0.1.
------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the results for some solid state tests using the pwf (for the
'bh' code), fhi (for 'abinit') and ncpp (for 'pwscf' ; converted to
their UPF format using the ncpp2upf utility)

All calculations were for the primitive fcc unit cell and used 2
Monkhorst-Pack special k-points.  Other details of the calculations
can be determined from the file: $OPIUM/tests/SSTESTS.tgz This file
contains all input and output files for all runs.

3 pseudopotentials were tested (all results in eV), all potentials
were the "optimized style" (RRKJ).

Total energies:

Al (LDA-PZ) 
abinit   -57.935217
pwscf    -57.934777
bh       -57.934650

Cu (GGA-PBE)
abinit   -1146.941458
pwscf    -1146.953800
bh       -1146.948708 

Fe (LDA-PZ w/ LFC core correction)
abinit    -766.122236
pwscf     -766.084198
bh        -766.067291

update for release 2.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an additional set of tests showing that the pwscf format bug
that was introduced in version 1.0.2 is now removed in version 2.0.2
