------------------------------------------------------------
Opium release 1.0.1.
------------------------------------------------------------

For some older versions of the gcc compiler, the some of the
C routines cannot be compiled using -O2 level of optimization.
If this occurs for you, simply re-"configure" using:

./configure "CFLAGS=-O1" 

and then

make

If this doesn't work, consider moving down to -O0 (for the CFLAGS
only!)  or upgrading your gcc compiler.
