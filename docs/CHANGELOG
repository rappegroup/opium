1.0.1 --> 1.0.2

	1) Further improvement of handling of s,p,d ordering problem
	   Tried the following tests for .pwf, .ncpp, and .fhi output styles:
	    Ag - 4d,5s,5p valence ordering s-local
	    Ag - 5s,5p,4d                  s-local
	    Ag - 4d,5s,5p                  local not specified (check default = s NOT 1st state)

	    Ti - 3s,3p,3d,4s,4p            s-local
	    Ti - 3s,4s,3p,4p,3d            s-local
	    Ti - 3s,3p,4s,4p,3d            '0' local (l=0)

	    Li - 1s,2s,2p                  local not specified
	    Li - 1s,2p,2s                  local not specified
	    
	    For each group, bh, abinit, and pwscf give the same results to ~8 digits.

	2)  Code should be totally case insensitive (all strcmp's replaced with strcasecmp).

	3)  Param file appened to fhi, ncpp files (thanks Wissam!)

	4)  Plot help 'vi' example corrected.

        5)  Added fclose() in do_nl.c (thanks Keith!)

        6)  Configure script modifed to allow LDFLAGS to be appended from command line

        7)  Fixed spelling of Schrodinger in descreen.f
 
        8)  AE and PS eigenvalues were actually reversed in descreen.f (they are
            identical so no big deal).

        9)  Fixed bug in nllogd for KB log-derivative (missed common block)
 
        10) Adjusted do_logplt so 'ae ps nl' need not be repeated to make plot (thanks Rongqin!)

        11) Added line for refernece energy in logder plot (thanks Rongqin!)

        12) Modified treatment of unbound states to work with semicore (thanks Sara!)

        13) Modified output for .ncpp and .fhi to indicate PW XC correctly

        14) Changed MacOSX configure defs so -r8 included by default

        15) Major modfication of ghost state reporting, now states whether ghost testing
            was inconclusive (no bound states for local potential)

        16) Ghost testing added for unbound states as local or non-local

        17) Interp.f output cleaned up

        18) Logder plotting states that no [loginfo] key block is set (not just a core dump!)

        19) Fixed legends for plots that were not correct

1.0.2 --> 1.0.3

1) Ghost testing fixed, removed the '?' output if a local state was
not bound.  Now this eigenvalue is treated as if its eigenvalue = 0.0

2) Changed the way an unbound state is selected.  Now, if the filling
is set to <-1.0e-12, the state is treated as unbound (and treated as
if it is empty).  The eigenvalue is fixed by the guess or set to 0.0
if no guess specified.

3) Added the .recpot output format routines (contributed by Keith
Refson).  This format is native to the solid state code CASTEP.

4) Added GNU license information, license header prepended to every .f
.c and .h file and added a "COPYING" file which contains the full-text
of the license.

5) Fixed bug related to DNL in the PWF format (introduced in the
previous version).

6) Added the Fuchs + Scheffler partial core correction method which is
implemented in fhi98pp.

7) Fixed bug related to labeling the eigenvalues in the logdplot

8) Changed keyblock help to reflect #2 and #6 above.

9) Configure script changed such that ifort and ifc libcxa gets
statically linked (requested by Keith Refson).

10) Added true NULL characters to nwrite calls in writepwf for better
compatibility.
