------------------------------------------------------------
Opium release 1.0.1.
------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the results for some solid state tests using the pwf (for the
'bh' code), fhi (for 'abinit') and ncpp (for 'pwscf' ; converted to
their UPF format using the ncpp2upf utility)

All calculations were for the primitive fcc unit cell and used 2
Monkhorst-Pack special k-points.  Other details of the calculations
can be determined from the file: $OPIUM/tests/SSTESTS.tgz This file
contains all input and output files for all runs.

3 pseudopotentials were tested (all results in eV), all potentials
were the "optimized style" (RRKJ).

Total energies:

Al (LDA-PZ) 
abinit   -57.935217
pwscf    -57.934777
